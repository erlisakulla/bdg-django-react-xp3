# Overview of Changes From Last Sprint
* Complete change of backend framework - from Node.js to Django
* Implementation of Django REST framework
* Significant changes in frontend design and structure (mainly using react-bootstrap components)
* Created backend Django API
    - ...
* Connecting frontend and backend using `axios`
    - User login and registration using axios and JWT token authentication
    - Game instances creation

# Project Overview
* **Backend**: Django
* **Python**: React

This project is divided into two main apps: [backend](backend) and [frontend](frontend). They must be run separately at the same time. But first clone the repository using:
```
git clone https://github.com/lorenzorota/se-03-team-32.git
```
## Backend

## Frontend
### Setup
To run the frontend, follow these steps:
1. Change to the frontend directory
```
cd frontend
```
2. Install all dependencies (check [`package.json`](frontend/package.json) for more details)
```
npm install
```
3. Run the app in development mode
```
npm start
```
4. Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The page will reload automatically if you make any changes.

### Dependencies
Some main packages and libraries used in this project:
* [Material UI](https://material-ui.com) (`@material-ui`) - this is a very useful library for using icons and frontend reusable components. Go to the Components sections to find the full documentation on how to implement them. In this project, this is mostly used for icons.
* [React Bootstrap]() (`react-bootstrap`) - rebuilt Bootstrap library specifically for React without needing to implement jQuery. Go to the Components sections to find the full documentation on how to implement them. In this project, some components used from this library are Button, Form, Table, Modal etc.
* [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) (`axios`) - library to make it easier to send asynchronous HTTP requests to REST endpoints and perform CRUD operations. We have used `axios` to connect our React app to the Django backend server and handle API requests. The [`axios.js`](frontend/src/App.js) file sets up the axios connection and the token handling.
* [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start) (`react-router-dom`) - DOM bindings for React Router (`react-router`). Useful for using Link components and setting up Routes in the [`App.js`](frontend/src/App.js) file.

### Documentation
For the documentation of the frontend we have used JSDoc. The configuration file is [`jsdoc.json`](frontend/jsdoc.json) and the output directory is the [`docs`](frontend/docs) folder.
1. Intsall JSDoc (globally) using:
```
npm install -g jsdoc
```
2. To compile all the changes made in the documentation run (inside frontend directory):
```
npm run doc
```
3. Open the [`index.html`](frontend/docs/index.html) file (locally is fine), found in the [`docs`](frontend/docs) directory, to see the generated documentation

For more information check out the [JSDoc repository](https://github.com/jsdoc/jsdoc) or this [Style Guide](https://github.com/shri/JSDoc-Style-Guide#links).
